#what if forms or surveys could be built rapidly?

what if you could use a human readable shorthand to build user forms in plain text?

## What if...

- a text input was made like this? :: 
    - with a label like this? [label]::
    - with default text like this? [label] :: ("default text")
    - with a label, default text, and a character limit like this? 
        - [label] :: ("default text" /20/)
    - with a custom validator was made like this? :: (/text/)
        - or this? ::(/email/)
        - or this, regex eh? ::(/*^[\d]+?$*/)
    - a range input was made like this ::(10-200)
    - a date input was made like this ::(mm/dd/yyyy)
    - a date range input was made like this ::(02/12/2014-mm/dd/yyyy)

- different input types were made like this? 
    - number keyboards ::(#)
    - email keyboards ::(@)
    - url keyboards ::(www)
    - password masking ::(*)

- a select was made like this ::(-)
    : option 1 [value]
    : option 2 [value]
    :: option 3 default [value]

- a radio group was made like this? ::(o)
    : option 1 [value]
    : option 2 [value]
    :: option 3 default [value]

- a checkbox group was made like this? ::([])
    : option 1 [value]
    : option 2 [value]
    :: option 3 default [value]

- a button was made like this {Send your form!}("post/url.html")
    - or like this? {Send your form!}(submit)
    - or like this? {Send your form!}{id}


### I don't know. 

I think it would be pretty cool. In fact, if we could partner it with integrations like [IFTTT](http://ifttt.com) I think it could be really useful.
